# PigLatin

## Description
This is a small and cute little project that allows your computer
 to **translate any message** to the "language" **pig latin**! 
**Pig latin** is a language in which every word of your message 
is altered. To use it, take the initial consonant or consonant cluster 
of each word and **move it** to the end of the word while **adding 
an "ay"** to the end as well. Right now **it prompts you to chose 
what mode you want**, either simple where it moves 2 letters and adds 
an "ay", custom where is asks you to specify how many letters you want 
moved, and makes you choose what letters to add at the end of each word, 
or classic where it does exactly what is says on Wikipedia. The 
algorithm for detecting consonant clusters is very laggy, so **feel 
free to add your own code and improve the program**! 

## How do you use it?
Initially, the program asks you:  
`Type your message in English:`  
 
Once you have typed your message it will ask:  
`Do you want simple Pig Latin (simple), custom Pig Latin (custom), or classic Pig Latin? (classic):`
