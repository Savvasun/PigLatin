# PigLatin

This is a small and cute little project that allows your computer to translate any message to the "language" <b>pig latin</b>! <b>Pig latin</b> is a language in which every word of your message is altered. To use it, take the initial consonant or consonant cluster of each word and <b>move it</b> to the end of the word while <b>adding an "ay"</b> to the end as well. Unfortunately, the program <b>doesn't have the ability recognize consonants and such</b> as it right now it prompts you to specify how many letters you want moved, and makes you choose what letters to add at the end of each word, so <b>feel free to add your own code and improve the program</b>!
